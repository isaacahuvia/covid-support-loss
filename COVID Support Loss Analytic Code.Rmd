# Study Overview

This study investigates loss of mental, behavioral, and/or emotional support in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic among undergraduate students at a large university. The goal of this study is to gather evidence on the extent of this loss and whether it differs by individual characteristics. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions:

1. What is the extent of loss of support during the COVID-19 pandemic among members of a large university community?
2. Does loss of support differ by (a) sociodemographic factors or (b) levels of depression and anxiety symptomatology, including suicidal ideation?

This is an exploratory study and we do not have specific hypotheses regarding the extent of support loss, or whether/how it differs across the above conditions.

Analyses are limited to complete cases only. This drops `r before - after` of `r before` cases.

# Sample Description

```{r}

  select_at(vars(-matches("^GAD_[1-9]"),
                 -matches("^PHQ_[1-9]"))) %>%

  mutate(Variable = factor(Variable, levels = names(df.dummy))) %>%
  group_by(Variable) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(value)) %>%
  mutate(`Mean/Frequency` = case_when(Variable %in% c("GAD7", "PHQ") ~ as.character(round(mean, 1)),
                                      T ~ percent(mean, accuracy = .1))) %>%
  select(Variable, `Mean/Frequency`) %>%
  kable() %>%

# Support loss by COVID impacts

A quick table to aid in the interpretation of above t-tests

```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(supportLoss) %>%

                          round(sd(GAD7), 2), ")"),
            PHQ = paste0(round(mean(PHQ), 2), " (",
                         round(sd(PHQ), 2), ")"))%>%
  kable(digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling()
```
